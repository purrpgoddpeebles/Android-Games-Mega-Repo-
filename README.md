# Android-Games-Mega-Repo-
This is a collection of android games that I am testing then archiving in my terabox to build the ultimate collection of games compatible with android since my Android phone is an android 7.1 LGLV 86 Running Nougat With An Arm-V7 Armeabi Processor then it's limited to 32 bit compatibility but I do have a cloud phone on it thru the app Ugphone that has 64 bit capabilities and I can use it on my 32 bit android phone and it works perfectly so that's what I will use for apps that need 64 bit optimization this will be a collection of stable releases as well as beta releases before I upload them on here I'm leaving reviews for them in several different App Stores that the game would be available in such as Google Play, Aptoide,Uptodown etc.
If the game is the latest stable release I will put /Latest_Stable next to the game after I type in the games name of its The Latest Nightly/Beta I will put Latest_NB After The Games Title If It's An Earlier Version I Will Put Downgrade_Version Then Whatever Version The App Is So Example Given Say It's An Old Version  Of Clash Of Royale And The Version is 1.10.17 and it's not the latest release or an earlier beta It will look like this "Clash Of Royale Downgrade_Version 1.10.17" say that version happens to be an older beta release tho and not a new beta but an older one then I will just put Clash Of Royale Old_Beta 1.10.17 

So I Hope You All Enjoy This Repo I Plan In Putting Some Work Into It And Make It Grow 💯
